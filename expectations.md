# :raised_hands: Cohort Expectations

As a cohort, how youâ€™d like to interact with one another to form a safe, welcoming and cohesive space for learning?

Consider:

What will help you learn most?

- Have clear context for learning (spikes, sharing resources....)
- Communication across teams (code reviews, sharing learning)
- Good time and scope managment
- Vary the dynamic (change up the teams)
- Talk about real world/ practical applications to the projects you are doing

What might prevent you from learning?

- Unclear expectations or unclear timelines 
- Stretched or overwhelming goals, especially those set by ourselves
- Being in the right headspace
- External factors e.g health

What will make you feel comfortable, included, and able to give your best?

- Get cosy and have the freedom to have fun
- Getting to know our team members on a personal level 
- Be mindful of each other's (dis)abilities
- Respect each others cultures and differences

What would your ideal learning environment feel like?

- Appropriate level of challenge
- Concise, constructive and caring feedback
- Engagment from everyone
