# Cleaning Rota & Discord Sweep

Each week one person is designated to be in charge of keeping things clean. This person is responsible for:

- collecting links shared in the cohort's Zoom and Discord channels throughout the week and adding them to the [resources directory](${github-org}/resources)

- ensuring that all project and spike [presentations](${github-org}/presentations) have been uploaded by each team

- passing on the duties to the next person on the rota and informing them of what they need to do

On days when we are in Space4, the 'cleaner' is also the cohort representative for the following cleaning tasks:

- Emptying clean items from the dishwasher in the mornings
- Emptying the kitchen waste and recycling bins if they're full (leave them next to the black bin on the street)
- Replacing the kitchen towel (fresh ones should be under the sink)
- Reminding people to wash their cups/dishes 
- Watering the plants
- Make sure the room isn't cluttered/messy

We share the classroom space with the wider Space4 coworking community, do remember that these responsibilities are also shared with other members using the space!

You might also want to offer some help with cleaning in the evenings for the two people behind you in rota - it's tough work for one person!

Thanks :sparkles:
