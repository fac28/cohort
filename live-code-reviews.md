## week 1 - Server
- general
  - show them how to use eslint and prettier
    - make sure comments do not end up on master or console logs don't end up on master
    - did everyone manage to deploy, I could go through this
    - show them how to use nodemon
- SummerButterfly
  - you don't have any instructions for running your project
  - or how to run the tests
  - comments shouldn't be left in production files
  - show them how to use backtick syntax highlighting
  - could have better naming for this template
  - https://github.com/fac28/SummerButterfly/blob/49c45a54e045e418614c7900cec4f6a36a11028a/templates.js#L52
- HahaHub
  - you use == everywhere, you should always use ===
    - you left a console.log in somewhere
    - we're not to be using frameworks or libraries at this stage of the course
    - in the server, you wouldn't name a folder scripts
    - you don't need to equality check against empty string here, you can just do if(!name)
      - https://github.com/fac28/HahaHub/blob/e90e5a9f461172897cc56b08471ad3ffbf07dcfd/scripts/server.js#L47
    - upRoute and downRoute not being used, should be removed to another branch
- week1-microblogging-fac28
  - here you could do an early return
    - https://github.com/cazanelena/week1-microblogging-fac28/blob/0c66d71187985127f078b6bfdba820e38c7ac5c5/src/server.js#L34-L41
      
## Week 2 - Database
- general
    - show how to do object destructuring
    - this function could do with some refactoring
        - [https://github.com/fac28/DoggyDB/blob/bb0325420ca8094aa2173235a7bc0ec04d1190a9/routes/booking.js#L4-L39](https://github.com/fac28/DoggyDB/blob/bb0325420ca8094aa2173235a7bc0ec04d1190a9/routes/booking.js#L4-L39)
    - you don't want to call a function from the model inside the template file
    - it looks like some teams focused a lot on database, that's definitely okay. I could show how to test the database in isolation (db-issy-tess-tommaso-james)
    - is prettier working for people? I didn't see a config file for it
    - add 'no-console' to rules
- DoggyDB
    - you put `npm start` in instructions but it should be `npm run dev`
    - you could use object destructuring here
        - [https://github.com/fac28/DoggyDB/blob/bb0325420ca8094aa2173235a7bc0ec04d1190a9/routes/bookingForm.js#L15-L19](https://github.com/fac28/DoggyDB/blob/bb0325420ca8094aa2173235a7bc0ec04d1190a9/routes/bookingForm.js#L15-L19)
    - if you only use a variable once then you most of the time you don't need to create a variable
        - [https://github.com/fac28/DoggyDB/blob/bb0325420ca8094aa2173235a7bc0ec04d1190a9/routes/bookingForm.js#L20-L25](https://github.com/fac28/DoggyDB/blob/bb0325420ca8094aa2173235a7bc0ec04d1190a9/routes/bookingForm.js#L20-L25)
    - I wouldn't recommend using `+=` as it's confusing to read
        - you could just put the `content` inside the template string at the same time you're reassigning it
    - values already filled in for making a booking, is it meant to work like that?
    - there are no instructions for seeding the project
    - there are console.log's left in
    - sorting mechanism for bookings is cool üòé
    - I like that you used capital letters for templates üëåüèΩ
    - great splitting out routes into their own files
- natureBase
    - you don't want to call a function from the model inside the template file
        - [https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/templates.js#L99-L132](https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/templates.js#L99-L132)
    - if a variable is only used in one place then you probably don't need it
        - [https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/routes/add.js#L9-L10](https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/routes/add.js#L9-L10)
    - you could use an early return here
        - [https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/routes/add.js#L37-L43](https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/routes/add.js#L37-L43)
    - I'm not 100% sure here but I think you should be importing the `app` from. `server.js` and then adding doing `const router = app.Router()`
        - [https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/routes/add.js#L1-L4](https://github.com/fac28/natureBase/blob/f2903a1389ce41eb665ebb67d7243fdc9dc5efdd/src/routes/add.js#L1-L4)
    - form goes all the way to the bottom when there's an error submitting
    - very cool that values remain even after server-side validation
    - great modularisation of routes
    - no eslint config or prettier config
- db-issy-tess-tommaso-james
    - you could use object destructuring here
        - [https://github.com/fac28/db-issy-tess-tommaso-james/blob/ed2bd472d4bec7668578e1e4a6e1009c5eac5e7b/src/server.js#L24-L28](https://github.com/fac28/db-issy-tess-tommaso-james/blob/ed2bd472d4bec7668578e1e4a6e1009c5eac5e7b/src/server.js#L24-L28)
    - you could have an early return here rather than this `else` block
        - [https://github.com/fac28/db-issy-tess-tommaso-james/blob/ed2bd472d4bec7668578e1e4a6e1009c5eac5e7b/src/server.js#L49-L64](https://github.com/fac28/db-issy-tess-tommaso-james/blob/ed2bd472d4bec7668578e1e4a6e1009c5eac5e7b/src/server.js#L49-L64)
    - when I press submit on the form all the values are wiped if one isn't working, a stretch goal could be to keep the values already entered in there
    - how come the cuisine name has to be unique? surely multiple types of restaurants could have the same type of cuisine
    - you don't have eslint or prettier
    - there are console.log's left in
        - [https://github.com/fac28/db-issy-tess-tommaso-james/blob/ed2bd472d4bec7668578e1e4a6e1009c5eac5e7b/src/server.js#L29](https://github.com/fac28/db-issy-tess-tommaso-james/blob/ed2bd472d4bec7668578e1e4a6e1009c5eac5e7b/src/server.js#L29)
    - there aren't any instructions for seeding the database
    - the instructions for running the database aren't the right ones for dev/local environment (it should be `npm run dev`)
    - cool use of `normalize.css`

## Week 3 - Authentication
- PactPortal
		- you might wanna abstract out a createCookie function so you can have cleaner route and put constant values in one place. (or even just abstract out the cookie options)
			- https://github.com/fac28/PactPortal/blob/901e8b8c05e6d3e1cefe8721f3afaca08262a81e/src/routes/sign-up.js#L30-L35
			- https://github.com/fac28/PactPortal/blob/901e8b8c05e6d3e1cefe8721f3afaca08262a81e/src/routes/log-in.js#L34-L39
		- how come you used `cross-env`?
		- i could show them how to make 'protected-route' middleware
		- i liked how your template and route folder have a similar structure
		- how come you're passing `req` and `res` to both these functions if those arguments aren't being used?
			- https://github.com/fac28/PactPortal/blob/901e8b8c05e6d3e1cefe8721f3afaca08262a81e/src/templates/home.js#L4-L41
		- how are you getting the logs in the console?
		- you can use early return here
			- https://github.com/fac28/PactPortal/blob/901e8b8c05e6d3e1cefe8721f3afaca08262a81e/src/routes/sign-up.js#L23-L44
		- do we want to see how to install husky?
		- in your error handling you could reply with something to the user
			- https://github.com/fac28/PactPortal/blob/901e8b8c05e6d3e1cefe8721f3afaca08262a81e/src/routes/log-in.js#L34-L39
			- show them how to mock errors in the code by just throwing
		- just a matter of stylistic preference but you could combine these two lines into one
			- https://github.com/fac28/PactPortal/blob/901e8b8c05e6d3e1cefe8721f3afaca08262a81e/src/routes/user.js#L15-L16
	- bookmarks2
		- there's similar logic in these two routes, you could abstract it out into middleware
			- https://github.com/fac28/bookmarks2/blob/0e4b53cd8cf3e307f799087156e83c886680ec5d/src/routes/bookpage.js#L1-L46
		- to run locally you do `npm run dev` in your project. if i used `npm start` the env variables wouldn't be set
			- https://github.com/fac28/bookmarks2/blob/0e4b53cd8cf3e307f799087156e83c886680ec5d/README.md?plain=1#L29-L37
		- no eslint or prettier config
		- love how tidy your server file is üòç
		- console.log's left in
		- you don't need an else block here because you've already got an early return
			- https://github.com/fac28/bookmarks2/blob/0e4b53cd8cf3e307f799087156e83c886680ec5d/src/routes/log-in.js#L17-L36
		- how come you use the login routes for `/log-in` endpoint but also for `/my-shelf` endpoints
			- it's a bit confusing that some routes are getting set multiple times
		- `createBook` should probably run with `run` rather than `get` as you're not using the book that's returned
		- love both these early returns on the 'failure' path
			- https://github.com/fac28/bookmarks2/blob/0e4b53cd8cf3e307f799087156e83c886680ec5d/src/routes/bookpage.js#L10-L44
	- play-dates
		- to run locally you do `npm run dev` in your project. if i used `npm start` the env variables wouldn't be set
			- https://github.com/fac28/play-dates/blob/73ed1d513efa40118e8a7a9ce22ced9fdf668058/README.md?plain=1#L36-L38
		- still quite a few console logs left in
		- this isn't doing anything, there is no rule called `prettier/prettier` as far as I know. maybe a confusion between prettier and eslint here
		- love how tidy the server is üòç
		- how come you assign `currentMonth` and then only use it to assign to `month` variable. can't you just call it `month` to start with? (same with year two lines above actually)
			- https://github.com/fac28/play-dates/blob/73ed1d513efa40118e8a7a9ce22ced9fdf668058/src/routes/home.js#L14-L15
		- these lines could come up at the top of the route for greater readability
		  id:: 651dffab-2b1d-476c-9d12-771d767d4fe1
			- https://github.com/fac28/play-dates/blob/73ed1d513efa40118e8a7a9ce22ced9fdf668058/src/routes/home.js#L17-L21
		- I can go to `/form` without being signed in (show how to do protected routes)
		  id:: 651e0022-6c30-455e-9175-407439c3e7a7
			- also form-route.js is not the best naming. it should be more specific to whatever the app is doing (`events.js`)
			- https://github.com/fac28/play-dates/blob/73ed1d513efa40118e8a7a9ce22ced9fdf668058/src/routes/form-route.js#L15-L28
		- similar to above, you can tidy code up by checking for active session straight away and returning early if there isn't one
		  id:: 651e01e0-09ce-43f1-89f7-d299042e611f
			- https://github.com/fac28/play-dates/blob/73ed1d513efa40118e8a7a9ce22ced9fdf668058/src/routes/month.js#L10-L28
