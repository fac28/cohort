# Pastoral support

Pastoral Support is given to every member of the cohort. The aim of pastoral support is to give you an environment to ask questions, raise concerns, or discuss your experience with a member of the FAC staff team.

We'll meet at regular intervals throughout the programme with times scheduled in advance. If you need to re-arrange the time, let your mentor know in advance. We'll aim to remind you each week that pastoral support is scheduled.

Founders and Coders are not trained to provide you with mental health support. We cannot give you advice but will aim to answer your questions and help you to resolve any issues you're facing throughout the course. This space can also be used to explore frustrations or vent in a healthy and moderated environment.

You're welcome to reach out to your mentor between sessions if you have questions or concerns.

Mentors will ask questions, listen carefully, and document what students share. Mentors are not expected to solve problems on the spot and will report back to the rest of the staff team on what has been discussed.
